Detailed Analysis

1. Header Files and Namespace:
   - `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input-output stream library, which allows the use of `cin` and `cout` for user input and output.
   - `using namespace std;`: This line allows the program to use standard library features without prefixing them with `std::`.

2. Main Function:
   - `int main() { ... }`: This is the entry point of the program where execution starts.

3. Variable Declarations:
   - `int num1, num2;`: Declares two integer variables to hold the numbers entered by the user.
   - `char op;`: Declares a character variable to hold the operation symbol.

4. User Input:
   - `cout << "Enter first number: ";`: Prompts the user to enter the first number.
   - `cin >> num1;`: Reads the first number from user input.
   - `cout << "Select the Operation (+,-,*,/): " << endl;`: Prompts the user to select an arithmetic operation.
   - `cin >> op;`: Reads the selected operation.
   - `cout << "Enter Second number: ";`: Prompts the user to enter the second number.
   - `cin >> num2;`: Reads the second number.

5. Operation and Output:
   - The `if-else` block checks the value of `op` to determine which arithmetic operation to perform.
     - `if (op == '+') { ... }`: If the operator is `+`, it calculates the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
     - `else if (op == '-') { ... }`: If the operator is `-`, it calculates the difference.
     - `else if (op == '*') { ... }`: If the operator is `*`, it calculates the product.
     - `else if (op == '/') { ... }`: If the operator is `/`, it calculates the quotient.
   - `else { ... }`: Handles invalid operator input by displaying an error message.

6. Return Statement:
   - `return 0;`: Ends the `main` function and returns 0, indicating successful execution.

 Improvements and Considerations

1. Division by Zero:
   - The program does not handle the case where the user enters `0` for division, which would cause a runtime error. You should add a check to prevent division by zero.

2. Floating-Point Operations:
   - Currently, the program performs integer arithmetic. For floating-point numbers, consider using `float` or `double` for `num1`, `num2`, and the result.

3. Input Validation:
   - Additional validation could be added to check whether the user has entered valid numbers and operators.
